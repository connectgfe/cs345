# BUGFIX:
#
# It appears that Java does *NOT* remove old .class files when compilation
# fails.  So we had a student who had an old, buggy implementation of the
# code (which compiled).  When they changed it to a new (non-compiling)
# version, javac (correctly) fails to compile the code but (maddeningly)
# leaves the old .class files around.  So, when the code runs, the student
# sees the old behavior, for reasons that they don't understand.

# BUGFIX:
#
# When there is an error which breaks some (but not all) of the files, javac
# will abort *all* of the builds.  So we had a student who lost *all* of his
# testcase points because *some* testcases were broken.  So we'd like to
# build all of the files individually.
#
# However, doing it that way (by default) is likely to be quite slow.  So
# we will instead only fall back on that plan when the original compile
# fails.
